Simple Proof of concept to use a Flow to create a Salesforce Org using Signup API

Contains:
1. Object `Trialforce Templates` which contains the templates that can be exposed to be signed up.
2. A Screen flow which prompts users for information to create the org

Take a look at the flow. In particular, look at the "Insert Signup Request" element which sets the default values for the Signup Request
